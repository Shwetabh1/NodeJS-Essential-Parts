Why use Node.js

Node.js is a single-threaded but highly scalable system that utilizes JavaScript as its scripting language. It uses asynchronous, event-driven I/O instead of separate processes or threads. It is able to achieve high output via single-threaded event loop and non-blocking I/O.

Everything is asynchronous.
Does noot create new threads unlike other languages such as Java etc which creates a new thread or even a process for every request.
