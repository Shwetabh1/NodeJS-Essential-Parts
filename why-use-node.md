<h2>Why use Node.js?</h2>

1.Node.js is a single-threaded but highly scalable system that utilizes JavaScript as its scripting language. 
1.It uses asynchronous, event-driven I/O instead of separate processes or threads. 
1.It is able to achieve high output via single-threaded event loop and non-blocking I/O.
1.For new requests it does not create new threads but uses the background workers. 
That is the advatage over other languages such as Java etc which creates a new thread or even a process for every request.
